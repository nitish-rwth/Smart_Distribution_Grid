# Smart Grid Project
Smart (MV) distribution grid built as part of my master thesis titled "Development of a co-simulation environment for automated congestion management in electrical distribution networks".\
Three Core models uploaded.\
Models for Smart Home, MV grid and CMS added.\
All models based in python (with mosaik wrappers for co-simulation).
